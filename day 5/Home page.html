        Dell’s success can be attributed in large part to its “direct model.” While competitors like Compaq and IBM sold PCs through retailers, distributors, and resellers, Dell sold directly to its customers, offering highly customized PCs at a time when the cost of computers was high enough to still require significant tradeoffs. The bulk of sales came from business and government, as big customers appreciated the ability to customize a large number of PCs; Dell also offered these companies customized portals where employees could buy one of several company-approved computers directly.

        This simple strategy proved wildly successful. Competitors like IBM and Compaq struggled with the politics of managing their various channel partners and lagged Dell in inventory management. When competitors tried to copy the direct model, their channel partners — fearing for their own businesses — objected, preventing other PC makers from fully going direct.
