            Dell is an American company that develops, sells, repairs, and supports computers and related products and services, and is owned by its parent company of Dell Technologies. Founded in 1984 by Michael Dell, the company is one of the largest technology corporations in the world, employing more than 165,000 people in the United States (US) and around the world.[4][5]

Dell sells personal computers (PCs), servers, data storage devices, network switches, software, computer peripherals, HDTVs, cameras, printers, and electronics built by other manufacturers. The company is well known for its innovations in supply chain management and electronic commerce, particularly its direct-sales model and its "build-to-order" or "configure to order" approach to manufacturing—delivering individual PCs configured to customer specifications.[6][5] Dell was a pure hardware vendor for much of its existence, but with the acquisition in 2009 of Perot Systems, Dell entered the market for IT services. The company has since made additional acquisitions in storage and networking systems, with the aim of expanding their portfolio from offering computers only to delivering complete solutions[buzzword] for enterprise customers.[7][8]

Dell was listed at number 51 in the Fortune 500 list until 2014.[9] Its rank is 34th on the Fortune 500 currently.[10] It is the world's 3rd largest personal computer vendor by unit sales as of January 2021, following Lenovo and HP Inc..[11] Dell is the largest shipper of PC monitors worldwide.[12] Dell is the sixth-largest company in Texas by total revenue, according to Fortune magazine.[13] It is the second-largest non-oil company in Texas (behind AT&T) and the largest company in the Greater Austin area.[14] After going private in 2013, the newly confidential nature of its financial information prevents the company from being ranked by Fortune. It was a publicly traded company (Nasdaq: DELL), as well as a component of the NASDAQ-100 and S&P 500, until it was taken private in a leveraged buyout which closed on October 30, 2013.

In 2015, Dell acquired the enterprise technology firm EMC Corporation; following the completion of the purchase, Dell and EMC became divisions of Dell Technologies. Dell EMC as a part of Dell Technologies focus on data storage, information security, virtualization, analytics, cloud computing and other related products and services.[15]

    <h2><b> Founding and startup</b></h2>
    <p> Michael Dell founded Dell Computer Corporation, doing business as PCs Limited, in 1984 while a student at the University of Texas at Austin.[16] Operating from Michael Dell's off-campus dormitory room at Dobie Center,[17] the startup aimed to sell IBM PC-compatible computers built from stock components. Michael Dell started trading in the belief that by selling personal computer systems directly to customers, PCs Limited could better understand customers' needs and provide the most effective computing solutions to meet those needs.[18] Michael Dell dropped out of college upon completion of his freshman year at the University of Texas at Austin in order to focus full-time on his fledgling business, after getting about $1,000 in expansion-capital from his family.[19] As of April 2021, Michael Dell's net worth was estimated to be over $50 billion.[20]

        In 1985, the company produced the first computer of its own design — the "Turbo PC", sold for US$795[21][22] — containing an Intel 8088-compatible processor running at a speed of 8 MHz. PCs Limited advertised the systems in national computer magazines for sale directly to consumers, and custom assembled each ordered unit according to a selection of options. This offered buyers prices lower than those of retail brands, but with greater convenience than assembling the components themselves. Although not the first company to use this business model, PCs Limited became one of the first to succeed with it. The company grossed more than $73 million in its first year of trading.
        
        The company dropped the PC's Limited name in 1987 to become Dell Computer Corporation and began expanding globally. At the time, the reasoning was this new company name better reflected its presence in the business market, as well as resolved issues with the use of "Limited" in a company name in certain countries.[23] The company set up its first international operations in Britain; eleven more followed within the next four years. In June 1988, Dell Computer's market capitalization grew by $30 million to $80 million from its June 22 initial public offering of 3.5 million shares at $8.50 a share.[24] In 1989, Dell Computer set up its first on-site service programs in order to compensate for the lack of local retailers prepared to act as service centers.</p>
